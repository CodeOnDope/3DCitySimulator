# 3D City Simulator

The **3D City Simulator** is an HTML5 web application for creating and visualizing procedurally generated urban scenes. Users can spawn buildings with different shapes, materials and colors, explore the city with navigation tools and experiment with several rendering and lighting modes.

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Click **Generate City** to populate a random layout.
3. Use the navigation controls to move around the scene.
4. Select buildings to modify their properties or change the global view settings.

## Interface Overview

The interface has two main sections:

- **3D Viewport** – displays the generated city.
- **Controls Panel** – the sidebar on the right with all options.

Within the panel you will find controls for city generation, building properties, perspective and lighting settings as well as visualization modes.

## Building Creation and Editing

- Use **Generate City** to create a layout or **Randomize** for a new configuration.
- Buildings can be cubes, cylinders or pyramids (mixed mode will choose randomly).
- Select a building to adjust its width, height, depth, color or material.

## Perspective Controls

Toggle between 1‑point, 2‑point and 3‑point perspectives. The **Refresh Vanishing Point** button aligns the vanishing points with the current camera view. Perspective lines can also be enabled to visualize convergence.

## View Modes

Available modes include **Shaded**, **Wireframe**, **Wireframe on Shaded**, **X‑Ray** and **Silhouette**. Choose the mode that best highlights the features you want to study.

## Material Properties

Each building can use different material presets such as **Clay**, **Pencil Sketch**, **Paper**, **Metal**, **Glass**, **Plastic**, **Concrete** or **Wood**.

## Lighting Options

Switch between **Daylight**, **Night** and **Sunset** lighting. Intensity, ambient light and shadows can be adjusted for custom setups.

## Navigation Tools

Use **Tumble**, **Pan** and **Dolly** to orbit, move and zoom the camera. Preset camera views are provided for quick access to common angles.

## Visualization Options

Scene brightness, contrast, bloom effect and fog can be tweaked to refine the appearance of the city. Vanishing points, ground grid and reference lines can be shown or hidden as needed.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `R` – Reset the camera
- `G` – Generate new city
- `W` – Toggle wireframe
- `S` – Toggle shadows
- `F` – Focus on selected building
- `Esc` – Deselect current building

## Troubleshooting

If performance is slow, try disabling shadows and bloom or reduce the number of buildings. For display issues, ensure you are using an up‑to‑date browser with JavaScript enabled.
